## Use Case Descriptions for Securing GenAI Applications with PAIG

### Use Case 1: Observability in Default Access Policy

**Scenario Description**:
In this observability-centric use case, PAIG is configured to focus on monitoring and logging activities when a GenAI
application is newly integrated. Initially, the application permits access to all users, which serves as a vital phase
for collecting data on user interactions and system responses. This unrestricted access phase is instrumental for
gathering insights into how users typically engage with the application, identifying common query patterns, and
evaluating the effectiveness of default security settings, such as PII data redaction.

**Examples**:

### Use Case: Monitoring Sensitive Data in User Interactions

**Scenario Description**:
In this use case, PAIG focuses on tracking and analyzing instances where users, such as Sally, inadvertently enter sensitive data in their queries, or when the GenAI application generates responses containing sensitive data.

1. **User Behavior Analysis**:
    - **Situation**: Sally, or similar users, engage with the GenAI application, posing questions or providing information
   that might unintentionally include sensitive data.

    - **Observation**: PAIG monitors these interactions in real-time, focusing specifically on the detection of sensitive
   data within both the user's input (prompts) and the AI's output (responses). The system logs any occurrence of
   sensitive data, such as personal identifiers or confidential information.

    - **Outcome**: This vigilant monitoring helps in assessing the effectiveness of data protection measures within the
     application. By identifying patterns or frequency of sensitive data appearance, PAIG aids in fine-tuning the
     application's privacy controls and response mechanisms. This ensures that user interactions with the GenAI
     application remain secure and compliant with data privacy standards.

2. **Audit and Compliance Readiness**:
    - **Situation**: All user queries and system responses are logged.
    - **Observation**: PAIG provides a comprehensive audit trail that includes details of user access, query content,
      and system responses.
    - **Outcome**: This detailed logging is crucial for compliance audits and understanding the application’s adherence
      to data privacy regulations.

By employing PAIG in this observability use case, organizations can gain valuable data-driven insights into user
behaviors and system performance, while ensuring that the GenAI application's security and privacy controls are
operating as intended from the outset.

### Use Case 2: Deny Access Policy

**Scenario Description**:
This use case demonstrates the enforcement of a restrictive access policy. By default, PAIG allows all users to access
the AI application, but this policy can be modified to deny access. For instance, if the permission settings are altered
to exclude a specific user group, users from that group who attempt to access the AI application will receive a denial
message. This scenario is instrumental in testing and validating the access control mechanisms of PAIG and ensuring that
unauthorized access is effectively prevented.

**Examples**:

**1. Restricted Access for Sensitive Projects:**

- **Situation**: A new AI application is developed for handling sensitive project information, requiring limited access.
- **Implementation**: PAIG’s settings are configured to deny access to all users except for a select group working on
  the project.
- **Outcome**: When unauthorized users attempt to access the application, they receive a denial message. This ensures
  that sensitive project details remain confidential and accessible only to authorized personnel.

**2. Access Restriction for External Consultants:**

- **Situation**: External consultants are granted limited access to an organization’s AI applications.
- **Implementation**: PAIG's policies are adjusted to exclude these consultants from accessing certain sensitive
  applications.
- **Outcome**: Consultants receive an access denial message when trying to open restricted applications, ensuring that
  they only access information pertinent to their role.

**5. Compliance with Legal Restrictions:**

- **Situation**: Due to legal compliance, certain user groups (like users from specific geographical locations) must be
  restricted from accessing specific data within AI applications.
- **Implementation**: PAIG’s policies are fine-tuned to deny access to these user groups.
- **Outcome**: Affected users encounter an access denial message upon attempting to use the application, helping the
  organization stay compliant with legal requirements.

These examples illustrate how the Deny Access Policy can be applied in various real-world scenarios, showcasing PAIG's
flexibility in managing access controls according to organizational needs, legal requirements, and security protocols.


### Use Case 3: Selective Redaction of Sensitive Information

**Scenario Description**:
In this scenario, PAIG is configured to selectively redact PII data from prompts and responses based on user roles and
group memberships. While the default setting is to redact all sensitive information for general users, PAIG allows the
display of actual PII data for certain authorized users or groups as per operational needs. This selective redaction
showcases PAIG’s adaptability in balancing data privacy with functional requirements.

**Examples**:

1. **Access for HR Department**:
    - **Situation**: The HR department requires access to employee PII for internal operations.
    - **Implementation**: PAIG is configured to not redact PII data in responses when accessed by users from the HR
      group.
    - **Outcome**: HR personnel can view complete employee data, while other users see redacted information, ensuring
      privacy compliance and operational efficiency.

2. **Customer Support Handling Sensitive Queries**:
    - **Situation**: Customer support agents require access to customer PII for resolving specific queries.
    - **Implementation**: PAIG selectively disables redaction based on the nature of the customer support query and the
      agent's clearance level.
    - **Outcome**: Agents can view necessary customer PII to provide effective support, while ensuring general queries
      still uphold PII redaction.

3. **Research Team Accessing Health Data**:
    - **Situation**: A research team working on health analytics needs access to patient data, which includes sensitive
      health information and PII.
    - **Implementation**: PAIG is set to redacted PII data to the research team members.
    - **Outcome**: Researchers can access complete patient data necessary for their analysis, while ensuring strict
      privacy controls are in place for data they shouldn't be seeing.

These examples demonstrate the capability of PAIG to provide context-sensitive and role-based redaction controls,
offering a nuanced approach to data privacy and access management.
