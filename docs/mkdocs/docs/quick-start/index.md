# Quick Start with PAIG

Welcome to the Quick Start Guide for PAIG. Whether you are looking to integrate with a GenAI application quickly or want
to explore the capabilities of PAIG, this guide provides two convenient options: using a Google Colab Notebook for a
cloud-based approach, or a downloadable local sample application for those who prefer a more hands-on experience.

> All the Quick Start notebooks and sample applications are also available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/privacera/paig/tree/main/notebooks/paig-os/){ target="_blank" }

Here are some of the Quick Starts for trying out the integrations with PAIG.
